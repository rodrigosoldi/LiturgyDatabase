# LiturgyDatabase Project Rules

## Build and Deploy Rule

When the user says "build and deploy" or "bd", execute the following sequence:

1. Execute the script `./generateDatabase.sh` to build and generate the database
2. Check git status for changes
3. If there are changes:
   - Add all changes to staging with `git add -A`
   - Get the latest tag number and increment it by 1
   - Create a commit with a descriptive message about the changes
   - Create a new tag with the incremented version number
   - Push both the commit and tag to the remote repository
4. Provide a summary of what was completed

This rule automates the complete build, database generation, and deployment process.
