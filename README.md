## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding LiturgyMakeRealmDatabase as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift` or the Package list in Xcode.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/rodrigosoldi/LiturgyMakeRealmDatabase.ig", branch: "main")
]
```

Normally you'll want to depend on the `LiturgyMakeRealmDatabase` target:

```swift
.product(name: "LiturgyMakeRealmDatabase")
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can download `LiturgyMakeRealmDatabase` and run it manually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodrigosoldi/LiturgyMakeRealmDatabase.git
```

## Usage

To execute the project run:
_*Make sure you have `swift` installed on your machine._

```swift
swift run
```

It will iterate all jsons in folder `Liturgies` trying to add them to the database..
To add more liturgies, create new jsons and add on `Liturgies` folder.
See [Example](#example) to create a readable json.

You will see the path of the database, and a little description for each liturgy added on database.

## Features

- [x] Make from JSON
- [ ] Get JSON from server
- [ ] SPM project consuming it database _(in progress)_

## Examples

Once you download the project you will see an [Example JSON](./Example/example.json) at folder `Examples`. Feel free to update it json and run project to see updates.
Follow its structure to create new liturgies.
I suggested you create one json file by liturgy day, but the structure is already prepared to receive an array of liturgies.
